##Hello Octocat

I love Octocat. She's the coolest cat in town.

#CHICKEN WEIGHTS

##Null Hypothesis
* No relationship exists between type of feed supplement and chick weight.

##Alternative Hypothesis
* The feed supplement most resemblant of the wild type nutrient will promote the highest weight gain in the chicks.
```{r chicken_weights, echo = TRUE}

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)

# import dataset
chkwt <- read.csv("chkwts.csv")
chkwts <- tbl_df(chkwt)
chkwts

# Explore data with plots
qplot(x = feed,
      y = weight,
      data = chkwts,
      geom = "boxplot",
      xlab = "Feed",
      ylab = "Weight (g)",
      main = "Neonate chicks' weight per feed supplement type")

# Statistical Test (ANOVA)
ANO.VA <- aov(weight~feed, data = chkwts)
summary(ANO.VA)

# Correct for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni post hoc test
pairwise.t.test(chkwts$weight, chkwts$feed,
                p.adjust.method = 'bonferroni',
                paired = FALSE)
```

##Test Assumptions
* Gaussian distribution
* Equal variance amongst groups
* Independent errors
* Data are unmatched

##Outcome Analysis
* Casein promotes the most growth out of all the feed supplements, while horsebean promotes the least. There is no statistical difference between the  casein, meat meal, and sunflower supplements, suggesting that the latter two are as statistically efficient in promoting growth. However, this does not signify biological efficiency. 
* Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis

#THE HOT ZONE

##Null Hypothesis 
* There is no relationship beween consumption of contaminated water and presentation with gastroenteritis. 

##Alternative Hypothesis 
* Consumption of contaminated water causes gastroenteritis. 

```{r the_hot_zone, echo = TRUE}


# import dataset
gastroe <- read.csv("hotzone.csv")
gastro <- tbl_df(gastroe)
head(gastro)
tail(gastro)


# Cross tabulate with xtabs
gastroX <- xtabs(~Consumption + Outcome,
      data = gastro)
gastroX



# plot gastroX
barplot(gastroX, beside = TRUE,
        main = "Relationship between gastroenteritis presentation and the amount of consumed contaminated water by people in a small town",
        xlab = "Presentation",
        ylab = "Number of People",
        col = c("black", "red", "grey"))

par(xpd = TRUE)
legend("topright", c("< 1 glass/day", "< 4 glasses/day", "> 4 glasses/day"), bty = "n", fill = c("black", "red", "grey"))

# Statistics (Pearson's Chi-squared Test)
 ChiSq <- chisq.test(gastroX, correct = FALSE)
 ChiSq
```
##Statistical Test
* Pearson's Chi-square test
* X-squared = 74.925, degrees of freedom = 2, p value < 2.2e-16

### Test Assumptions:
* random sampling
* independent observations
* large sample size
* discrete probability in observed frequencies within the table can be estimated by the continuous X^2^ distribution

##Outcome Analysis
* The p value indicates a significant relationship between the amount of contaminated water consumed and whether or not a given individual presented with gastroenteritis. Namely, the amount of contaminated water consumed was directly proportional to gastroenteritis incidences.
* Therefore, reject the null hypothesis.


#NAUSEA

##Null Hypothesis
* Administration of 5HT3 receptor antagonist does not ameliorate nausea intensity. 

##Alternative Hypothesis
* Administration of 5HT3 receptor antagonist decreases nausea intensity. 
```{r Nausea, echo = TRUE}
# import data set
nnausea <- read.csv("nausea.csv")
nausea <- tbl_df(nnausea)
nausea

# Assuming that that the '40' in the dataset is an error (given that it exceeds the pain scale), I've changed it to '4'.

nausea[8,3] = 4
nausea

# plot dataset
plot(nausea$Nausea_before~nausea$Patient,
     col = "red",
     type = "o",
     ylim = c(0,6),
     ylab = "Nausea Rating",
     xlab = "Patient",
     main = "Nausea intensity ratings before and after administration of a 5HT# receptor antagonist")
lines(nausea$Nausea_after~nausea$Patient)
points(nausea$Nausea_after~nausea$Patient)
legend(4,6, c("Nausea before", "Nausea after"), fill = c("red", "black"))

# Statistical test (Wilcoxin Signed-rank test)
wilcox.test(nausea$Nausea_before, nausea$Nausea_after, paired = TRUE)
```

## Statistical Test
* Wilcoxin signed-rank test

###Test Assumptions:
* central limit theorem applies  
* independent errors
* effective data matching 

##Outcome Analysis
* Ratings of nausea intensity significantly decreased following adminisatration of the 5HT3 receptor antagonist. Therefore, reject the null hypothesis.

#HOUSE PRICES

##Null Hypothesis 
* No relationship exists between the interest rate and the price of housing.

##Alternative Hypothesis
* An inversely proportional relationship exists between the interest rate and the price of housing.

```{r house_prices, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)

# view the dataset
house_price <- read.csv("hspri.csv")
hspri <- tbl_df(house_price)
hspri

# explore dataset with plots


qplot(x = interest_rate,
      y = median_house_price_USD,
      data = hspri,
      main = "Relationship between interest rates and median house prices in the U.S.A",
      xlab = "Interest Rate (%)",
      ylab = "Median House Prices ($)")

# perform Spearman Correlation
hspri.cor <- with(hspri, cor.test(x = interest_rate, y = median_house_price_USD, method = 'spearman'))

# print summary of the correlation
hspri.cor
```
##Statitstical Test
* Spearman Correlation
###Test Assumptions:
* variables are measured on using ordinal, ratio, or interval scales
* a monotonic relationship exists between the variables (i.e the variables are proportional to one another, but not at the same rate)

##Outcome Analysis
* The plot and statistical test shows that no relationship/corrlation exists between the measured variables. Therefore accept the null hypothesis.
